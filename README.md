Given a list of activities to be done in certain hours of the day (assume only full hours), create the schedule of the minimum number of days that fits them all.

To run, simply run
```
python holiday_activities.py
```

or open the Jupyter Notebook with 
```
jupyter notebook holiday_activities.ipynb
```
and then run all the Kernel.
